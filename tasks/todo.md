# iOS CI/CD Masterclass (GitHub Actions) — Plan

**Goal:** A production-grade, beginner→advanced iOS CI/CD masterclass using GitHub Actions,
delivered as (a) structured Markdown docs under `docs/cicd/` and (b) real, working,
heavily-commented pipeline files at their natural repo locations.

**Running example:** hypothetical production app — Swift / SwiftUI / UIKit / MVVM / SPM,
multiple targets, schemes Dev / QA / Staging / Production, hosted on GitHub.

**Teaching style (per topic):** concept → why → where it fits → ASCII diagram →
real config/code → line-by-line → internals → common mistakes → debugging → best practices.

**Pacing:** incremental batches; user reviews and says "continue".

## Review

### Batch 1 (Parts 1–3)
- Created `docs/cicd/README.md` (index) + Parts 1–3 docs.
- Scaffolded real folder skeleton: `.github/workflows/`, `fastlane/`, `Configurations/`, `Scripts/`
  each with a README explaining its purpose (content filled in later batches).
- Next: say "continue" for Batch 2 (Actions keywords, pipeline design, runners).
